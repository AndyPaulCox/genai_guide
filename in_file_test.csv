You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the \napplicable statutes and regulations.  To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office \nresponsible for  this guidance  as listed on the title page .   \n \n \n \nI. INTRODUCTION  \n \nThis guidance is intended to assist sponsors, clinical investigators , contract research \norganizations, institutional review boards  (IRBs) , and other interested parties on the use of \nelectronic health record data in FDA -regulated clinical investigations.2  For the purposes of this \nguidance, electronic health record  (EHR ) systems3are electronic platforms that contain \nindividual health recor ds for patients .  EHR systems are  generally maintained by health care \nproviders , health care organizations , and health care  institutions  and are used to deliver care .  \nEHR systems can be used to integrate real-time electronic health care  informa tion from medical \ndevices and multiple  health care providers involved in the care of patient s.    \n \nFor the purposes of this guidance, a n EHR  is an individual patient record contained within the \nEHR system.  A typical individual EHR  may include a patient’s medical history, diagnoses,  \ntreatment plans, immunization dates, allergies, radiology images, pharmacy records , and \nlaboratory and test results.   This guidance uses broad definition s of EHR s and EHR  systems  to \nbe inclusive of many different types of EHR s and EHR systems .4 \n \n                                                 \n1 This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Medical Policy and the Office of Translational Sciences in the \nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research in cooperation with the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and \nthe Center  for Devices and Radiological Health at the Food and Drug Administration.  This guidance was developed \nin consultation with the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) at the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS).  \n \n2 For FDA’s regulatory definitions of a clinical investigation, see 21 CFR 50.3(c), 56.102(c), and 312.3(b).

"('page_content', 'Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  \n \n 4 III. BACKGROUND  \n \nFDA issued guidance on electronic source data in clinical investigations (eSource guidance).11  \nIn the eSource guidance, FDA addresses attributes of source data  used to fill predefined fields in \nan electronic case report form (eCRF ) that would satisfy FDA’s inspection, recordkeeping , and \nrecord retention requirements.12  The guidance acknowledges that data enter ed into  the sponsor’s \neCRF may be derived from a vari ety of sources, including EHRs . \n \nIn general, EHR  systems  are not under the control of FDA -regulated entities (e.g., sponsors , \nclinical investigators ).  In most instances, these systems  belong to  health care providers,  health  \ncare organizations , and health care institutions.  As provided in  the eSource guidance , FDA does \nnot intend to assess compliance of EHR systems  with 21 CFR part 11 .13  However, FDA ’s \nacceptance of data from clinical investigations for decision -making purposes depends on FDA ’s \nability to verify the quality and integrity of the data during FDA inspections (see 21 CFR parts \n312 and 812) .  This guidance clarif ies FDA’s  expectations when EHR s are used as  a source of \ndata in clinical investigations.  \n \nPotential Advantages of the Use  of EHRs  in Clinical Investigations  \n \nWith the widespread use of EHRs, there are opportunities to improve  data accuracy  and promote \nclinical trial efficiency when EHRs are used in clinical investigations.  EHRs may enable clinical \ninvestigators and study pe rsonnel to have access to many types of data  (e.g., clinical notes,  \nphysician orde rs, radiology,  laboratory , and pharmacy  records ) that can be combine d, \naggregate d, and analyze d.  EHR s may  have the potential to provide clinical investigator s and \nstudy personnel access to real -time data for review and can facilitate post -trial follow -up on \npatients to assess long -term safety and effectiveness  of medical products.  In addition, there are \nopportunities for long -term follow  up of large numbers of  patients , which may be of particular \nimportance  in studies  where the outcome of interest occurs rarely , such as in prophylaxis studies . \n \n \nIV. INTEROPERABILITY AND  INTEGRATION OF SYST EMS  \n \nFor the purposes of this guidance,  interoperability  refers  to the ability of two or more products, \ntechnologies , or systems to exchange information and to use the information that has been \nexchanged  without special effort on the part of the user .  EHR and EDC systems  may be \nnoninteroperable, interoperable, or full y integrated , depending  on supportive technologies and \nstandards .  \n \nNoninteroperable systems,  without  the capability for electronic exchange of EHR data in clinical \ninvestigations, involve manual transcription of data elements  from the EHR to the eCRF or to \n                                                 \n11 See the guidance for industry Electronic Source Data in Clinical Investigations . \n \n12 See footnote 5.  \n \n13 See footnote 11.  \n ')","('metadata', {'source': './ref_data/EHR_Data_Clinical_Investigations_Guidance.pdf', 'page': 6})",
"('page_content', 'Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  \n \n 5 the paper case report form, similar to the transcription performed with paper records.  Such \nmanual transcription procedures  may introduce risks of data entry errors unless effective quality \ncontrol systems are in place.  \n \nInteroperable systems  allow electronic transmission of relevant EHR data to the EDC system .  \nFor example, data elements originating in an EHR (e.g. , demographics, vital signs, laboratory \ndata, medications ) may automatically populate the eCRFs within an EDC system.  In addition, an \ninteroperable EHR and EDC system could provide access to additional  patient information \npopulated from other clinical information systems (e.g., radiology information systems, \nlaboratory information systems).   Interoperable systems  may simplify data collecti on for a \nclinical investigation by enabling clinical investigators and study personnel to capture source \ndata at the patient ’s point -of-care visit.  I nteroperable systems may also reduce errors in data \ntranscription , allowing for the improvement in data ac curacy and the quality  and efficiency  of the \ndata collected in clinical invest igations .  \n \nFully integrated systems  allow  clinical investigators to enter research data directly into the EHR.  \nThis may involve, for example, use of research modules, use of research tabs built into the  EHR \nsystem , or use of custom research fields within the EHR system for data that are entered for \nresearch  purposes .   \n \nFDA encourages sponsors and clinical investigators to work with entities that control EHR  \nsystems, such as h ealth care organizations, to use EHR and EDC systems that are interoperable \nor fully integrated.  Moreover,  diverse ownership of electronic systems  and data may necessitate \nappropriate collaboration between the health care  and clinical  research communities .  FDA \nencourages sponsors and health care organizations to work with EHR and EDC system vendors \nto further advance the interoperability and integration of these systems.  \n \nA. Data Standards  \n \nThere may be practical challenges to  the interoperability of EHR and EDC systems.  These \nchallenges may include the complex and diverse clinical  data standards used by the health care  \nand clinical research communities , which may hinder the exchange of information  between \ndifferent electronic systems.  Many of these challenges are being addressed by the adoption of \nopen data standards and through EHR data standardization  requirements as part of the ONC \nHealth IT Certification Program  and ONC’s Interoperability Standards Advisory .14  The data \nexchange bet ween  EHR and EDC systems should leverage the use of existing open data \nstandards , when possible , while ensuring that the integrity and security of data are not \ncompromised . \n \nB. Structured and Unstructured Data  \n \nFDA encourages exchange of structured data  (e.g., demographics, vital signs, laboratory data)  \nbetween EHR  and EDC systems so that data may be entered once at the point -of-care and used \nmany times without manual re -entry or manual source data verification.  Sponsors should e nsure \n                                                 \n14 The ONC Health IT C ertification Program and their processes are discussed further in section V.A of this \nguidance.

In addition, for extraction of \nunstructured data, sponsors should consider  the reliability and quality of unstructured EHR data \nand the appropriateness of using it as critical source data , such as study endpoints .   \n \nC. Validation  \n \nSponsors should ensure that the interoperability of EHR  and EDC systems  (e.g.,  involving the \nautomated electronic transmission of relevant EHR data to the EDC system ) functions in the \nmanner intended in a consistent and repeatable fashion and that the data are transmitted \naccurately, consistently , and completely .  The sponsor’s qua lity management plan (e.g., standard \noperating procedures , software development life cycle model, change control procedures) should \naddress the interoperability of the EHR and EDC  system and the automated electronic \ntransmission of EHR data elements to the EDC system.  Sponsors should  ensure that software \nupdates to the sponsor’s EDC systems d o not affect the integrity and security of EHR data \ntransmitted to  the sponsor’s EDC systems .  In addition, as part of the quality management plan, \nFDA encourages sponsors to periodically  check a subset o f the extracted data for accuracy, \nconsistency , and completeness with the EHR source data and make appropriate changes to the \ninteroperable system when problems with the automated data transfer are identified.  \n \nD. Data From Multiple EHR Systems  \n \nThe EHR system at the clinical investigation site may be interoperable with multiple EHR  \nsystems  from many different health care organizations or institutions that are not affiliated with \nthe clinical investigation site.  If data from multiple EHR  systems  from different health care \norganizations and institutions are integrated with EHR data at the clinical investigation site, data \nfrom another institution ’s EHR system  may be used and transmitted to the sponsor’s EDC \nsystem provided that  data sharing agreem ents are in place.  \n \n \nV. BEST PRACTICES  FOR USING EHR s IN CLINICAL INVESTI GATIONS  \n \nThe u se of EHRs as a source of data in clinical investigations may involve  additional \nconsiderations, planning, and management as described in this section.  Sponsors and clinical \ninvestigators should ensure that policies and processes for the use of EHRs at the clinical \ninvestigation site  are in place and that there are  appropr iate security  measures employed to \nprotect the confidentiality and integrity of the study data .   \n \nSponsors should also ensure that study monitors have suitable access to all relevant subject \ninformation pertaining to a clinical investigation , as appropriate.  Such access must be  described \nin the informed consent (see 21 CFR 50.25(a)(5)) (see section V.E) .  Furthermore, at any time \nduring the course of a clinical investigation, sponsors should discuss with the relevant FDA \nreview division any u nique issues or challenges encountered relating  to the data collection from \nthe EHRs  (see, e.g.,  21 CFR 312.41 ). \n ')","('metadata', {'source': './ref_data/EHR_Data_Clinical_Investigations_Guidance.pdf', 'page': 8})",

Use of Health Information Technology  Certified by ONC  \n \nThe Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical H ealth Act of 2009 (HITE CH \nAct) (Title XIII of Division A and Title IV of Division B of the American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act of 2009 ( Public Law 111\uf02d5)) require s that ONC establish a voluntary \ncertification program for health IT .15  Under the ONC Health IT C ertification Program, certified \nEHR technology  would be in compliance with applicable provisions under 45 CFR part 170 .  \nEHR technology with certified capabilities generally  has clear advantages , because many of the \ncertification requirements are aimed t oward  ensuring i nteroperable data  sharing and enabling \nprocesses to keep electronic data confidential and secure .  In particular, all EHR technology \ncertified under the ONC Health IT Certification Program is required to meet certain  privacy and \nsecurity protection require ments for an individual’s health information  (see 45 CFR \n170.314(d)(1) through (8)  and 45 CFR 170.315(d)(1) through (1 1)).  FDA encourages the use of \nsuch certified EHR  systems  together with appropriate policies and procedures for their use.   \n \nSponsors should include in their data management plan a list of EHR systems used by each \nclinical investigation site  in the clinical investigation .  Sponsors should document  the \nmanufacturer , model number , and version number of the EHR system and whether th e EHR \nsystem is certified by ONC.16  If an EHR system is decertified during the course of the clinical \ninvestigation  because the system no longer conforms to ONC’s certification criteria , spons ors \nshould determine the nature or reasons for the nonconformity and determine whether it would \naffect the quality and integrity of data used in the clinical investigation.  \n \nB. Use of EHR  Systems Not Certified by ONC  \n \nFDA recognizes the importance of data from foreign studies to support  safety and eff icacy \nclaims for medical products and may accept data from clinical studies cond ucted outside the \nUnited States.17  EHR  systems  not certified by ONC , including EHR  systems  at foreign clinical \nsites, can provide adequate data to inform FDA’s regulatory decis ions provided that  adequate \ncontrols are in place to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and security of data .  Specifically, for  \nEHR  systems  not certified by ONC, s ponsors should consider whether such systems have the \nfollowing privacy and security controls in place to ensure that the confidentiality, integrity, and \nsecurity of data are preserved:  \n \n\uf0b7 Policies and processes for the use of EHR  systems  at the clinical investigation site are in \nplace , and th ere are appropriate security  measures employed to protect the study data . \n \n\uf0b7 Access to electronic systems is limited to authorized users . \n \n                                                 \n15 80 FR 62602 at 62606.

If the clinical investigation site  is using a \nsystem that does not contain the adequate controls previously described in the bulleted items, \nspon sors should consider the risks of  employing such systems  (e.g., the potential harm to \nresearch subjects , patient privacy rights, and data integrity of the clinical investigation and its \nregulatory implications) . \n \nThe following information may be helpful to sponsors to determine the suitability of EHR \nsystem s not certified by ONC :   \n \n\uf0b7 Any EHR system certification information from other authorizing bodies outside the \nUnited States, including information about aspects of the EHR system that the \nauthorizing body evaluated when certifying the EHR  system  \n \n\uf0b7 Feature and product -specification information from the EHR system vendor  \n \nSponsors should consult with the relevant FDA review divisions if any issues or challenges with  \nthe EHR system are identified.  \n \nC. eSource Principles for EHRs  \n \nAs stated earlier in this guidance, FDA does not intend to assess EHR sys tems for compliance \nwith 21 CFR part 11.   However, part 11 applies to the sponsor’s EDC system that extracts the \nEHR data for use in a clinical investigation , and FDA intends to assess the sponsor’s EDC \nsystem for compliance with part 11 , as provided in the guidance for industry Part 11, Electronic \nRecords ; Electronic Signatures – Scope and Application .   \n \n1. Data Originator  \n \nFor the purposes of recordkeeping, audit trail s, and inspection, each electronic data element \nshould be associated with a data originator .  The EHR is identified as the data originator  for \nEHR data elements gathered during the course of a clinical investigation .18  Identifying the EHR \nas the data origin ator may be  sufficient because sponsors are not expected to know details about \nall users  who contribute information to the patient’s EHR.   \n \n                                                 \n18 See footnote 11.  \n ')","('metadata', {'source': './ref_data/EHR_Data_Clinical_Investigations_Guidance.pdf', 'page': 10})",
"('page_content', 'Contains Nonbinding Recommendations  \n \n 9 2. Data Modifications  \n \nAfter data are transmitted to the eCRF , the clinical investigator or delegated study personnel \nshould  be the only individuals authorized to make modifications or corrections to the data.  \nModified and corrected data elements should  have data element identifiers that reflect the date, \ntime, data originator , and the reason  for the change .  Modified and corrected data  should  not \nobscure previous entries.  Clinical investigators should review and electronically sign the \ncompleted eCRF for each study participant  before data are archived or submitted to FDA.   If \nmodifications a re made to the eCRF after the clinical investigator has already signed the eCRF, \nthe changes should be reviewed and approved by the clinical investigator.  Use of electronic \nsignatures  for records that are subject to 21 CFR part 11  must comply with relevan t requirements \nin that regulation  (see 21 CFR 11 .2). \n \nD. Blind ed Study Designs  \n \nWhen the study design is blinded, sponsors should consider whether the use of interoperable \nEHR and EDC systems has any potential to unblind the treatment allocation.  If a potential for \nunblinding is identified, sponsors should determine whether the use o f interoperable systems is \nappropriate or whether  other appropriate controls should be in place to prevent unblinding.  \n \nE. Informed Consent  \n \nWhen informed consent is required, the consent  must include a statement describing the extent , if \nany, to which con fidentiality of records identifying the subject will be maintained  (21 CFR \n50.25(a)(5))  and should identify entities , such as health  care providers, clinical investigators, \nsponsors, contract research organization s, study monitors , and regulatory agencies  who may gain \naccess to the patient’s electronic health record relating to the clinical investigation .19  In addition, \nthe consent process must also note the possibility that FDA may inspect records (21 CFR \n50.25(a)(5)) and should not state or imply that FDA  needs permission from the subject for  access \nto the records.  Please note that , under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act \n(HIPAA) privacy  rule, FDA does not need permission to inspect records containing health \ninformation (see 45 CFR 164.512).  FDA may inspect study records, for example, to assess \ninvestigator compliance with the study protocol and validity of the data reported by the sponsor . \n \nUnder section 704(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act  (21 U.S.C. 374(a)(1)) , \nFDA may inspect and copy records relating to the clinical investigation  (see 21 CFR 312.58(a), \n312.68, and 812.145(b) ).  FDA generally will not copy records that include the subject ’s name \nunless there is reason to believe the records do not represent the actual cases studied or results \nobtained.  When FDA requires  subject names, FDA will treat such information as confidential .  \nOn rare occasions, FDA may be requir ed to disclose  this information to third pa rties, such as  to a \ncourt of law  (see 21 CFR 20.63(a) and 20.83(a) and (b) ).  Therefore, the consent process should \nnot promise or imply absolute confidentiality by FDA.  \n \n                                                 \n19 For more information, see the draft guidance for IRBs, clinical i nvestigators , and sponsors Informed  Consent  \nInformation Shee t.

Make clear which confounders were adjusted for and why they were included.\n\n(b) Report category boundaries when continuous variables are categorised.\n\n(c) If relevant, consider translating estimates of relative risk into absolute risk for a meaningful time period.\n\n—\n\n—\n\n \n\nOther analyses\n\n17\n\nReport other analyses done—eg, analyses of subgroups and interactions, and sensitivity analyses.\n\n—\n\n—\n\n \n\nDiscussion \n\nKey results\n\n18\n\nSummarise key results with reference to study objectives.\n\n—\n\n—\n\n \n\nLimitations\n\n19\n\nDiscuss limitations of the study, taking into account sources of potential bias or imprecision. Discuss both direction and magnitude of any potential bias.\n\n19.1: Discuss the implications of using data that were not created or collected to answer the specific research question(s). Include discussion of misclassification bias, unmeasured confounding, missing data, and changing eligibility over time, as they pertain to the study being reported.\n\n19.1.a: Describe the degree to which the chosen database(s) adequately captures the drug exposure(s) of interest.\n\n\n\n \n\nInterpretation\n\n20\n\nGive a cautious overall interpretation of results considering objectives, limitations, multiplicity of analyses, results from similar studies, and other relevant evidence.\n\n—\n\n20.a: Discuss the potential for confounding by indication, contraindication or disease severity or selection bias (healthy adherer/sick stopper) as alternative explanations for the study findings when relevant. [A: Original text indicated this item was RECORD (ie, not RECORD-PE)?]\n\n \n\nGeneralisability\n\n21\n\nDiscuss the generalisability (external validity) of the study results.\n\n—\n\n—\n\n \n\nOther information \n\nFunding\n\n22\n\nGive the source of funding and the role of the funders for the present study and, if applicable, for the original study on which the present article is based.\n\n—\n\n—\n\n \n\nAccessibility of protocol, raw data, and programming code\n\n 22\n\n—\n\n22.1: Authors should provide information on how to access any supplemental information such as the study protocol, raw data, or programming code.\n\n—\n\n \n\nRECORD=reporting of studies conducted using observational routinely collected data; RECORD-PE=RECORD for pharmacoepidemiological research; STROBE=strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology.\n\n\n\n*REFERENCE: Langan SM, Schmidt S, Wing K, Ehrenstein V, Nicholls S, Filion K, Klungel O, Petersen I, Sorensen H, Guttmann A, Harron K, Hemkens L, Moher D, Schneeweiss S, Smeeth L, Sturkenboom M, von Elm E, Wang S, Benchimol EI.

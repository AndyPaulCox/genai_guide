It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page . I. INTRODUCTION This guidance is intended to assist sponsors, clinical investigators , contract research organizations, institutional review boards (IRBs) , and other interested parties on the use of electronic health record data in FDA -regulated clinical investigations.2 For the purposes of this guidance, electronic health record (EHR ) systems3are electronic platforms that contain\", \"individual health recor ds for patients . EHR systems are generally maintained by health care providers , health care organizations , and health care institutions and are used to deliver care . EHR systems can be used to integrate real-time electronic health care informa tion from medical devices and multiple health care providers involved in the care of patient s. For the purposes of this guidance, a n EHR is an individual patient record contained within the EHR system. A typical individual EHR may include a patient\\u2019s medical history, diagnoses, treatment plans, immunization dates, allergies, radiology images, pharmacy records , and laboratory and test results. This guidance uses broad definition s of EHR s and EHR systems to be inclusive of many different types of EHR s and EHR systems .4 1 This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Medical Policy and the Office of Translational Sciences in the\", \"Center for Drug Evaluation and Research in cooperation with the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and the Center for Devices and Radiological Health at the Food and Drug Administration. This guidance was developed in consultation with the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). 2 For FDA\\u2019s regulatory definitions of a clinical investigation, see 21 CFR 50.3(c), 56.102(c), and 312.3(b). For FDA\\u2019s regulatory definition of an investigation, see 21 CFR 812.3(h). 3 See the Glossary for definitions and usage of specific terms used throughout this guidance. Words and phrases in bold italics are defined in the Glossary. 4 We note that this definition of EHRs may not be consistent with the definition for EHRs published in other guidance documents.\", \"Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 2 This guidance provides recommendations on : \\uf0b7 Deciding whether and how to use EHRs as a source of data in clinical investigations \\uf0b7 Using EHR systems that are interoperable with electronic data capture (EDC) systems in clinical investigations \\uf0b7 Ensuring the quality and inte grity of EHR data collected and used as electronic source data in clinical investigations \\uf0b7 Ensuring that the use of EHR data collected and used as electronic source data in clinical investigations meets FDA\\u2019s inspection, recordkeeping , and record retention requirements5 In an effort to modernize and streamline clinical investigations, t he goals of this guidance are to: \\uf0b7 Facilitate the use of EHR data in clinical investigations \\uf0b7 Promo te the interoperability of EHR and EDC systems In general, FDA\\u2019s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.\", \"Instead, guidances describe the Agency\\u2019s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirem ents are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required. II. SCOPE The recommendations outlined in this guidance apply to the use of EHR data in: \\uf0b7 Prospective clinical investig ations of human drugs and biological products, medical devices, and combination products , including clinical investigations conducted in clinical practice settings6 5 For inspection requirements and principal recordkeeping requirements for clinical investigators who develop human drugs and biologic al product s, see 21 CFR 312.62 and 312.68. For medical devices, see 21 CFR 812.140 and 812.145.\", \"and 812.145. 6Conclusions about the risks and benefits of medical p roducts drawn from data, including EHR data, collected in routine clinical practice settings (i.e., outside of typical clinical research settings) are sometimes referred to as real world evidence. Such conclusions may be used to inform regulatory decision making, specifically in the approval of new indications for approved drugs and to satisfy post -approval study requirements. This guidance, which is intended to assist interested parties on the use of EHR data in FDA -regulated clinical investigations, sat isfies, in part, the mandate under the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act) (Pub lic Law 114-255) to issue guidance about the use of real world evidence in regulatory decision making. See Sec tion 3022 of the Cures Act. See also 21 U.S.C.\", \"Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 3 \\uf0b7 Foreign clinical studies not conducted under an investigational new drug application (IND) or an investigational device exemption (IDE) that are submitted to FDA in support of an application for the marketing approval of a medical product7 (see 21 CFR 312.120, 314.106, and 814.15) This guidance applies to data obtained from EHRs and EHR clini cal data warehouses that store and integrate EHR data. The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has adopted use of the broader term health IT in the ONC Health Information Technology (Health IT) Certification Program that includes EHRs and other forms of health IT that provide electronic data.8 Other forms of health IT may include mobile and tele health technology, medical devices and remote monitoring devices,\", \"assistive technologies, and sensors. Th is guidance does not apply to data from these other forms of health IT .

BACKGROUND FDA issued guidance on electronic source data in clinical investigations (eSource guidance).11 In the eSource guidance, FDA addresses attributes of source data used to fill predefined fields in an electronic case report form (eCRF ) that would satisfy FDA\\u2019s inspection, recordkeeping , and record retention requirements.12 The guidance acknowledges that data enter ed into the sponsor\\u2019s eCRF may be derived from a vari ety of sources, including EHRs . In general, EHR systems are not under the control of FDA -regulated entities (e.g., sponsors , clinical investigators ). In most instances, these systems belong to health care providers, health care organizations , and health care institutions. As provided in the eSource guidance , FDA does not intend to assess compliance of EHR systems with 21 CFR part 11 .13 However, FDA \\u2019s\", \"acceptance of data from clinical investigations for decision -making purposes depends on FDA \\u2019s ability to verify the quality and integrity of the data during FDA inspections (see 21 CFR parts 312 and 812) . This guidance clarif ies FDA\\u2019s expectations when EHR s are used as a source of data in clinical investigations. Potential Advantages of the Use of EHRs in Clinical Investigations With the widespread use of EHRs, there are opportunities to improve data accuracy and promote clinical trial efficiency when EHRs are used in clinical investigations. EHRs may enable clinical investigators and study pe rsonnel to have access to many types of data (e.g., clinical notes, physician orde rs, radiology, laboratory , and pharmacy records ) that can be combine d, aggregate d, and analyze d. EHR s may have the potential to provide clinical investigator s and study personnel access to real -time data for review and can facilitate post -trial follow -up on\", \"patients to assess long -term safety and effectiveness of medical products. In addition, there are opportunities for long -term follow up of large numbers of patients , which may be of particular importance in studies where the outcome of interest occurs rarely , such as in prophylaxis studies . IV. INTEROPERABILITY AND INTEGRATION OF SYST EMS For the purposes of this guidance, interoperability refers to the ability of two or more products, technologies , or systems to exchange information and to use the information that has been exchanged without special effort on the part of the user . EHR and EDC systems may be noninteroperable, interoperable, or full y integrated , depending on supportive technologies and standards . Noninteroperable systems, without the capability for electronic exchange of EHR data in clinical investigations, involve manual transcription of data elements from the EHR to the eCRF or to\", \"11 See the guidance for industry Electronic Source Data in Clinical Investigations . 12 See footnote 5. 13 See footnote 11.\", \"Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 5 the paper case report form, similar to the transcription performed with paper records. Such manual transcription procedures may introduce risks of data entry errors unless effective quality control systems are in place. Interoperable systems allow electronic transmission of relevant EHR data to the EDC system . For example, data elements originating in an EHR (e.g. , demographics, vital signs, laboratory data, medications ) may automatically populate the eCRFs within an EDC system. In addition, an interoperable EHR and EDC system could provide access to additional patient information populated from other clinical information systems (e.g., radiology information systems, laboratory information systems). Interoperable systems may simplify data collecti on for a clinical investigation by enabling clinical investigators and study personnel to capture source\", \"data at the patient \\u2019s point -of-care visit. I nteroperable systems may also reduce errors in data transcription , allowing for the improvement in data ac curacy and the quality and efficiency of the data collected in clinical invest igations . Fully integrated systems allow clinical investigators to enter research data directly into the EHR. This may involve, for example, use of research modules, use of research tabs built into the EHR system , or use of custom research fields within the EHR system for data that are entered for research purposes . FDA encourages sponsors and clinical investigators to work with entities that control EHR systems, such as h ealth care organizations, to use EHR and EDC systems that are interoperable or fully integrated. Moreover, diverse ownership of electronic systems and data may necessitate appropriate collaboration between the health care and clinical research communities . FDA\", \"encourages sponsors and health care organizations to work with EHR and EDC system vendors to further advance the interoperability and integration of these systems. A. Data Standards There may be practical challenges to the interoperability of EHR and EDC systems. These challenges may include the complex and diverse clinical data standards used by the health care and clinical research communities , which may hinder the exchange of information between different electronic systems. Many of these challenges are being addressed by the adoption of open data standards and through EHR data standardization requirements as part of the ONC Health IT Certification Program and ONC\\u2019s Interoperability Standards Advisory .14 The data exchange bet ween EHR and EDC systems should leverage the use of existing open data standards , when possible , while ensuring that the integrity and security of data are not compromised . B. Structured and Unstructured Data\", \"B. Structured and Unstructured Data FDA encourages exchange of structured data (e.g., demographics, vital signs, laboratory data) between EHR and EDC systems so that data may be entered once at the point -of-care and used many times without manual re -entry or manual source data verification. Sponsors should e nsure 14 The ONC Health IT C ertification Program and their processes are discussed further in section V.A of this guidance. For more information on ONC\\u2019s Interoperability Standards Advisory , see https://www.healthit.gov/isa/ .\", \"Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 6 that the structured data elements obtained from the EHR correspond with the protocol -defined data collection plan (e.g., time and method of measurement). In addition, for extraction of unstructured data, sponsors should consider the reliability and quality of unstructured EHR data and the appropriateness of using it as critical source data , such as study endpoints . C. Validation Sponsors should ensure that the interoperability of EHR and EDC systems (e.g., involving the automated electronic transmission of relevant EHR data to the EDC system ) functions in the manner intended in a consistent and repeatable fashion and that the data are transmitted accurately, consistently , and completely . The sponsor\\u2019s qua lity management plan (e.g., standard operating procedures , software development life cycle model, change control procedures) should\", \"address the interoperability of the EHR and EDC system and the automated electronic transmission of EHR data elements to the EDC system. Sponsors should ensure that software updates to the sponsor\\u2019s EDC systems d o not affect the integrity and security of EHR data transmitted to the sponsor\\u2019s EDC systems . In addition, as part of the quality management plan, FDA encourages sponsors to periodically check a subset o f the extracted data for accuracy, consistency , and completeness with the EHR source data and make appropriate changes to the interoperable system when problems with the automated data transfer are identified. D. Data From Multiple EHR Systems The EHR system at the clinical investigation site may be interoperable with multiple EHR systems from many different health care organizations or institutions that are not affiliated with the clinical investigation site. If data from multiple EHR systems from different health care\", \"organizations and institutions are integrated with EHR data at the clinical investigation site, data from another institution \\u2019s EHR system may be used and transmitted to the sponsor\\u2019s EDC system provided that data sharing agreem ents are in place. V. BEST PRACTICES FOR USING EHR s IN CLINICAL INVESTI GATIONS The u se of EHRs as a source of data in clinical investigations may involve additional considerations, planning, and management as described in this section. Sponsors and clinical investigators should ensure that policies and processes for the use of EHRs at the clinical investigation site are in place and that there are appropr iate security measures employed to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the study data . Sponsors should also ensure that study monitors have suitable access to all relevant subject information pertaining to a clinical investigation , as appropriate. Such access must be described\", \"in the informed consent (see 21 CFR 50.25(a)(5)) (see section V.E) . Furthermore, at any time during the course of a clinical investigation, sponsors should discuss with the relevant FDA review division any u nique issues or challenges encountered relating to the data collection from the EHRs (see, e.g., 21 CFR 312.41 ).\", \"Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 7 A. Use of Health Information Technology Certified by ONC The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical H ealth Act of 2009 (HITE CH Act) (Title XIII of Division A and Title IV of Division B of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ( Public Law 111\\uf02d5)) require s that ONC establish a voluntary certification program for health IT .15 Under the ONC Health IT C ertification Program, certified EHR technology would be in compliance with applicable provisions under 45 CFR part 170 . EHR technology with certified capabilities generally has clear advantages , because many of the certification requirements are aimed t oward ensuring i nteroperable data sharing and enabling processes to keep electronic data confidential and secure . In particular, all EHR technology certified under the ONC Health IT Certification Program is required to meet certain privacy and\", \"security protection require ments for an individual\\u2019s health information (see 45 CFR 170.314(d)(1) through (8) and 45 CFR 170.315(d)(1) through (1 1)). FDA encourages the use of such certified EHR systems together with appropriate policies and procedures for their use. Sponsors should include in their data management plan a list of EHR systems used by each clinical investigation site in the clinical investigation . Sponsors should document the manufacturer , model number , and version number of the EHR system and whether th e EHR system is certified by ONC.16 If an EHR system is decertified during the course of the clinical investigation because the system no longer conforms to ONC\\u2019s certification criteria , spons ors should determine the nature or reasons for the nonconformity and determine whether it would affect the quality and integrity of data used in the clinical investigation. B. Use of EHR Systems Not Certified by ONC\", \"B. Use of EHR Systems Not Certified by ONC FDA recognizes the importance of data from foreign studies to support safety and eff icacy claims for medical products and may accept data from clinical studies cond ucted outside the United States.17 EHR systems not certified by ONC , including EHR systems at foreign clinical sites, can provide adequate data to inform FDA\\u2019s regulatory decis ions provided that adequate controls are in place to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and security of data . Specifically, for EHR systems not certified by ONC, s ponsors should consider whether such systems have the following privacy and security controls in place to ensure that the confidentiality, integrity, and security of data are preserved: \\uf0b7 Policies and processes for the use of EHR systems at the clinical investigation site are in place , and th ere are appropriate security measures employed to protect the study data .\", \"\\uf0b7 Access to electronic systems is limited to authorized users . 15 80 FR 62602 at 62606. For information about the ONC Health IT Certification Program, see https://www.healthit.gov/policy -researchers -implementers /onc-health -it-certification -program . 16 Sponsors may check the certification status for EHR systems at https://chpl.healthit.gov/#/search . 17 See the guidance for industry and FDA staff FDA Acceptance of Foreign Clinical Studies Not Conducted Under an IN D \\u2014 Frequently Asked Questions .\", \"Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 8 \\uf0b7 Authors of records are identifiable . \\uf0b7 Audit trails are available to track changes to data . \\uf0b7 Records are available and retained for FDA inspection for as long as the records are required by applicable regulations (see section VI) . Sponsors should consider these factors when determining the suitability of EHR systems not certified by ONC for use in clinical investigations. If the clinical investigation site is using a system that does not contain the adequate controls previously described in the bulleted items, spon sors should consider the risks of employing such systems (e.g., the potential harm to research subjects , patient privacy rights, and data integrity of the clinical investigation and its regulatory implications) . The following information may be helpful to sponsors to determine the suitability of EHR system s not certified by ONC :\", \"system s not certified by ONC : \\uf0b7 Any EHR system certification information from other authorizing bodies outside the United States, including information about aspects of the EHR system that the authorizing body evaluated when certifying the EHR system \\uf0b7 Feature and product -specification information from the EHR system vendor Sponsors should consult with the relevant FDA review divisions if any issues or challenges with the EHR system are identified. C. eSource Principles for EHRs As stated earlier in this guidance, FDA does not intend to assess EHR sys tems for compliance with 21 CFR part 11. However, part 11 applies to the sponsor\\u2019s EDC system that extracts the EHR data for use in a clinical investigation , and FDA intends to assess the sponsor\\u2019s EDC system for compliance with part 11 , as provided in the guidance for industry Part 11, Electronic Records ; Electronic Signatures \\u2013 Scope and Application . 1. Data Originator\", \"1. Data Originator For the purposes of recordkeeping, audit trail s, and inspection, each electronic data element should be associated with a data originator . The EHR is identified as the data originator for EHR data elements gathered during the course of a clinical investigation .18 Identifying the EHR as the data origin ator may be sufficient because sponsors are not expected to know details about all users who contribute information to the patient\\u2019s EHR. 18 See footnote 11.\", \"Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 9 2. Data Modifications After data are transmitted to the eCRF , the clinical investigator or delegated study personnel should be the only individuals authorized to make modifications or corrections to the data. Modified and corrected data elements should have data element identifiers that reflect the date, time, data originator , and the reason for the change . Modified and corrected data should not obscure previous entries. Clinical investigators should review and electronically sign the completed eCRF for each study participant before data are archived or submitted to FDA. If modifications a re made to the eCRF after the clinical investigator has already signed the eCRF, the changes should be reviewed and approved by the clinical investigator. Use of electronic signatures for records that are subject to 21 CFR part 11 must comply with relevan t requirements in that regulation (see 21 CFR 11 .2).\", \"in that regulation (see 21 CFR 11 .2). D. Blind ed Study Designs When the study design is blinded, sponsors should consider whether the use of interoperable EHR and EDC systems has any potential to unblind the treatment allocation. If a potential for unblinding is identified, sponsors should determine whether the use o f interoperable systems is appropriate or whether other appropriate controls should be in place to prevent unblinding. E. Informed Consent When informed consent is required, the consent must include a statement describing the extent , if any, to which con fidentiality of records identifying the subject will be maintained (21 CFR 50.25(a)(5)) and should identify entities , such as health care providers, clinical investigators, sponsors, contract research organization s, study monitors , and regulatory agencies who may gain access to the patient\\u2019s electronic health record relating to the clinical investigation .19 In addition,\", \"the consent process must also note the possibility that FDA may inspect records (21 CFR 50.25(a)(5)) and should not state or imply that FDA needs permission from the subject for access to the records. Please note that , under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy rule, FDA does not need permission to inspect records containing health information (see 45 CFR 164.512). FDA may inspect study records, for example, to assess investigator compliance with the study protocol and validity of the data reported by the sponsor . Under section 704(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 374(a)(1)) , FDA may inspect and copy records relating to the clinical investigation (see 21 CFR 312.58(a), 312.68, and 812.145(b) ). FDA generally will not copy records that include the subject \\u2019s name unless there is reason to believe the records do not represent the actual cases studied or results\", \"obtained. When FDA requires subject names, FDA will treat such information as confidential . On rare occasions, FDA may be requir ed to disclose this information to third pa rties, such as to a court of law (see 21 CFR 20.63(a) and 20.83(a) and (b) ). Therefore, the consent process should not promise or imply absolute confidentiality by FDA. 19 For more information, see the draft guidance for IRBs, clinical i nvestigators , and sponsors Informed Consent Information Shee t. When final, this guidance will represent FDA\\u2019s current thinking on this topic.\", \"Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 10 For systems that are interoperable or fully integrated, sponsors and clinical investigators should have a detailed understanding of data flow and data visibility to allow for a clear description in the informed consent of the parties granted access to the patient\\u2019s data . VI. INSPECTION, RECORDKE EPING, AND RECORD RE TENTION REQUIREMENTS FDA must have access to records and may inspect and copy all records pertaining to a clinical investigation in accordance with 21 CFR 312.62, 312.68, 812.140, and 812.145. All relevant information in the EHR pertaining to the clinical investigation must be made available to FDA for review upon request (21 CFR 312.62(b), 312.68, 812.140(a), and 812.145).20 This information should be made available and viewable to FDA as orig inal records in the EHR or as certified copies .
